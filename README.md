# Intro - timer and stopwatch
built with 100% tkinter and python, this project looks to be used for streamers who dont want to use a google timer or Snaz because its confusing and dumb.

# Use
when using OBS or Streamlabs add a window capture, change the window match prioritiy to __Window title must match__ and deselect capture cursor. On statup make sure to run __pip install -r requirements.txt__ and __pip install -r --upgrade-pip__ in a command terminal (Windows: Win+r cmd + enter && cd <file install path>. Linux: ctrl+shift+t cd <file install path>).
when closing the window hit quit on the windows or you can just close the teminal, ittle scream at you if you use quit ignore it its fine and then close the terminal.

# The Future
So far we do not have a desktop app, I am looking at adding a more robust GUI(in progress), and a double window app(in progress).

# BUGS
on linux if youre having issues use __sudo apt install python3-tk__
